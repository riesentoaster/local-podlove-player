# local-podlove-player

A quick-and-dirty static website that allows using the [Podlove Web Player](https://podlove.org/podlove-web-player) to listen to local audio files and transcripts. Useful if you want to read while listening or want to be able to quickly copy paste things that you are listening to.

To generate transcripts from audio files, you may want to check out something like [mlx_whisper](https://pypi.org/project/mlx-whisper/).
